"""
Student Information Exercise - Week 2 Python Workshop

This module contains functions for managing student information.
Fix the logic errors and complete the missing functions!

LEARNING FOCUS:
- Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- Logical operators (and, or)
- Comparison operators (>=, <=, ==)
- Boolean return values (True/False)

NAMING CONVENTION REMINDER:
- Functions should start with verbs: calculate, get, check, is, has
- Variables should be nouns: student_score, grade_letter, total_marks
- Use descriptive names: is_passing (✅) vs pass_check (❌)

def calculate_grade(score):

    Convert a numerical score to a letter grade.

    Grade rules:
    - 90 to 100: 'A'
    - 80 to 89:  'B'
    - 70 to 79:  'C'
    - 60 to 69:  'D'
    - Below 60:  'F'

    Args:
        score (int or float): The student's score (0-100)

    Returns:
        str: The letter grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F')

    Determine a student's academic status based on age and grade level.
